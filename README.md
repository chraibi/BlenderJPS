# BlenderJPS - JuPedSim Trajectory Importer for Blender

A Blender addon for importing JuPedSim simulation SQLite files, visualizing agent trajectories and simulation geometry.

![Addon Preview](images/preview_v2.jpg)

## Features

- **Import JuPedSim SQLite files**: Load trajectory data and walkable area geometry
- **Animated Agents**: Each agent is represented as an animated sphere following their trajectory
- **Agent Path Visualization**: Each agent's complete path is automatically created as a curve object
- **Path Visibility Toggle**: Show/hide all agent path curves with a single checkbox
- **Geometry Visualization**: Walkable area boundaries and obstacles are displayed as curves
- **Big Data Mode**: Stream agents as particles for very large datasets
- **Display Controls**: Adjust agent scale, geometry thickness, and frame rate
- **Easy Installation**: Built-in dependency installer for required Python packages

## Requirements

- **Blender 4.0+** (Blender 3.x is not supported)
  - Development and testing on Blender 5.0
  - Should work on Blender 4.0+ but not actively tested
- **Python packages**: `pedpy`, `numpy<2.0` (installed automatically via addon)

> **Note:** `pedpy` is kept mainly for legacy compatibility and because we currently rely on its `shapely` dependency for geometry processing. SQLite reading is now handled via a streaming approach inspired by the [JuPedSim visualizer's reader](https://github.com/PedestrianDynamics/jupedsim/tree/master/python_modules/jupedsim_visualizer/jupedsim_visualizer).

## Installation

1. **Download the latest release** from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/FabianPlum/BlenderJPS/releases)
2. **Open Blender as your normal user** (do not run as Administrator/root for installation)
3. Go to **Edit → Preferences → Add-ons**
4. Click **Install...** and select the downloaded ZIP file
5. Enable the addon by checking the box next to "BlenderJPS - JuPedSim Importer"
6. **(Recommended)** If you started Blender without a terminal (e.g. on Windows by double‑clicking the icon), open **Window → Toggle System Console** before the next step. You can then see pip’s progress while dependencies install; Blender may look unresponsive for one or two minutes.
7. Expand the addon settings and click **Install Dependencies** (this installs `pedpy` and `numpy<2.0` into the addon folder)
8. **Restart Blender**

The **JuPedSim** panel will appear in the right sidebar of the 3D Viewport (press `N` if the sidebar is hidden).

> **Important:** Run Blender as the same user you use every day. If you install the addon or dependencies while Blender is run as Administrator/root, they are installed in that account’s Blender config. When you then start Blender as a normal user, the addon may not appear, or pedpy may not be found. Always install and use Blender as your normal user.

## Usage

1. Open Blender and go to the **3D Viewport**
2. Open the sidebar (press `N` if hidden)
3. Find the **JuPedSim** tab
4. Click **Browse...** to select your SQLite trajectory file
5. (Optional) Adjust **Load Every Nth Frame** to downsample temporal resolution for faster loading
   - `1` = Load all frames (default)
   - `2` = Load every 2nd frame (50% of keyframes)
   - `10` = Load every 10th frame (10% of keyframes) etc.
6. (Optional) Enable **Big Data Mode** to handle very large datasets (agents load as particles)
7. (Optional) Enable **Load Full Paths** if you want per-agent path curves
8. Click **Load Simulation**

### What Gets Created

- **JuPedSim_Agents** collection: Contains animated empty objects (sphere display) for each agent
  - Agents automatically hide after reaching their destination
  - Path curves for each agent showing their complete trajectory (hidden by default)
- **Big Data Mode**: Creates a single particle system driven by streamed frame updates
- **JuPedSim_Geometry** collection: Contains curve objects for boundaries and obstacles
- Animation timeline is automatically set to match the simulation frames

### Display Options

After loading a simulation, a **Display Options** section appears in the panel:

- **Agent Scale (m)**: Adjust size of agent spheres/instances
- **Geometry Thickness (m)**: Adjust thickness of walkable area curves
- **Frame Rate**: Quick access to Blender frame rate presets
- **Show Agent Paths**: Toggle checkbox to show/hide all agent path curves
  - Requires **Load Full Paths** on import
  - Paths are hidden by default but can be toggled on/off at any time
  - Each path is a 3D curve object showing the agent's complete trajectory

## Simulation Data Structure

The addon uses [PedPy](https://github.com/PedestrianDynamics/PedPy) (mainly for `shapely`) and streams the SQLite data similarly to the JuPedSim visualizer to read:

- **Trajectory data**: Agent positions over time (x, y coordinates per frame)
- **Walkable area**: The geometry defining where agents can move

## Troubleshooting

### Addon does not appear / pedpy not found after restart (macOS/Linux/Windows)
- **Do not run Blender as Administrator or root** for normal use or when installing the addon/dependencies. If you previously installed while running Blender as root (e.g. `sudo Blender` on macOS), the addon and pedpy were installed in root’s Blender config. A normal user session then uses a different config, so the addon may not show or pedpy may be “not found.”
- **Fix:** Run Blender as your normal user. Remove the addon from **Edit → Preferences → Add-ons** if it was installed as root. Install the addon again (Install... → enable) and click **Install Dependencies** while Blender is running as your normal user. Restart Blender as normal user. Dependencies are installed into the addon folder, so no admin rights are needed.

### "Dependencies not installed" error
- Install dependencies from **Edit → Preferences → Add-ons** → BlenderJPS → **Install Dependencies**. No Administrator/root required.
- Check the Blender console (Window → Toggle System Console on Windows; or run Blender from Terminal on macOS/Linux) for error messages
- Try reinstalling dependencies from the addon preferences

### "File not found" error
- Use absolute paths or ensure the file path is correct
- Check that the SQLite file is a valid JuPedSim trajectory file

### Agents appear at wrong scale
- JuPedSim uses meters as units. Make sure your Blender scene is set to metric units
- Agents are created as 1-meter diameter empty objects (sphere display) by default

### Loading takes too long
- Use the **Load Every Nth Frame** option to downsample the temporal resolution
- Enable **Big Data Mode** for very large datasets
- Disable **Load Full Paths** unless you really need per-agent curves
- For very large simulations, try values like 5 or 10 to significantly reduce loading time
- Linear interpolation will fill in the gaps between keyframes for smooth animation

## Development

For developers who want to work with the git repository and have changes reflected immediately in Blender:

### Development Installation (Symbolic Link)

Create a symbolic link to your `blender_jps` folder in your Blender addons directory. This allows for easier development as changes are reflected immediately.

**Windows:**
1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell as Administrator
2. Navigate to your Blender addons directory:
   ```cmd
   cd "%APPDATA%\Blender Foundation\Blender\<version>\scripts\addons"
   ```
   Replace `<version>` with your Blender version (e.g., `4.2`)
3. Create a symbolic link:
   ```cmd
   mklink /D blender_jps "C:\path\to\BlenderJPS\blender_jps"
   ```
   Replace `C:\path\to\BlenderJPS\blender_jps` with the actual path to your `blender_jps` folder

**macOS/Linux:**
1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to your Blender addons directory:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Blender/<version>/scripts/addons  # macOS
   # or
   cd ~/.config/blender/<version>/scripts/addons  # Linux
   ```
3. Create a symbolic link:
   ```bash
   ln -s /path/to/BlenderJPS/blender_jps blender_jps
   ```

4. Open Blender
5. Go to **Edit → Preferences → Add-ons**
6. Search for "JuPedSim" and enable the addon
