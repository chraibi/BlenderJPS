# BlenderJPS - JuPedSim Trajectory Importer for Blender

A Blender addon for importing JuPedSim simulation SQLite files, visualizing agent trajectories and simulation geometry.

## Features

- **Import JuPedSim SQLite files**: Load trajectory data and walkable area geometry
- **Animated Agents**: Each agent is represented as an animated sphere following their trajectory
- **Geometry Visualization**: Walkable area boundaries and obstacles are displayed as curves
- **Easy Installation**: Built-in dependency installer for required Python packages

## Requirements

- **Blender 4.0+** (tested with Blender 4.0 and later)
- **Python packages**: `pedpy`, `numpy<2.0` (installed automatically via addon)

## Installation

### Step 1: Download the Addon

Download or clone this repository. You need the `blender_jps` folder.

### Step 2: Install in Blender

#### Option A: Install from ZIP
1. Zip the `blender_jps` folder (the folder itself, not its contents)
2. Open Blender
3. Go to **Edit → Preferences → Add-ons**
4. Click **Install...** and select the ZIP file
5. Enable the addon by checking the box next to "BlenderJPS - JuPedSim Importer"

#### Option B: Manual Installation (Symbolic Link)
Create a symbolic link to your `blender_jps` folder in your Blender addons directory. This allows for easier development as changes are reflected immediately.

**Windows:**
1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell as Administrator
2. Navigate to your Blender addons directory:
   ```cmd
   cd "%APPDATA%\Blender Foundation\Blender\<version>\scripts\addons"
   ```
   Replace `<version>` with your Blender version (e.g., `4.2`)
3. Create a symbolic link:
   ```cmd
   mklink /D blender_jps "C:\path\to\BlenderJPS\blender_jps"
   ```
   Replace `C:\path\to\BlenderJPS\blender_jps` with the actual path to your `blender_jps` folder

**macOS/Linux:**
1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to your Blender addons directory:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Blender/<version>/scripts/addons  # macOS
   # or
   cd ~/.config/blender/<version>/scripts/addons  # Linux
   ```
3. Create a symbolic link:
   ```bash
   ln -s /path/to/BlenderJPS/blender_jps blender_jps
   ```

4. Open Blender
5. Go to **Edit → Preferences → Add-ons**
6. Search for "JuPedSim" and enable the addon

### Step 3: Install Dependencies (IMPORTANT)

The addon requires the `pedpy` Python package. To install it:

1. **Close Blender completely**
2. **Run Blender as Administrator** (Windows) or with elevated privileges (macOS/Linux)
   - Windows: Right-click Blender → "Run as administrator"
   - macOS: `sudo /Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender`
   - Linux: `sudo blender`
3. Go to **Edit → Preferences → Add-ons**
4. Find "BlenderJPS - JuPedSim Importer" and expand its settings
5. Click **Install Dependencies**
6. Wait for the installation to complete
7. **Restart Blender** (normal mode, no admin needed)

## Usage

1. Open Blender and go to the **3D Viewport**
2. Open the sidebar (press `N` if hidden)
3. Find the **JuPedSim** tab
4. Click **Browse...** to select your SQLite trajectory file
5. (Optional) Adjust **Load Every Nth Frame** to downsample temporal resolution for faster loading
   - `1` = Load all frames (default)
   - `2` = Load every 2nd frame (50% of keyframes)
   - `10` = Load every 10th frame (10% of keyframes) etc.
6. Click **Load Simulation**

### What Gets Created

- **JuPedSim_Agents** collection: Contains animated empty objects (sphere display) for each agent
  - Agents automatically hide after reaching their destination
- **JuPedSim_Geometry** collection: Contains curve objects for boundaries and obstacles
- Animation timeline is automatically set to match the simulation frames

## Simulation Data Structure

The addon uses [PedPy](https://github.com/PedestrianDynamics/PedPy) to read JuPedSim SQLite files containing:

- **Trajectory data**: Agent positions over time (x, y coordinates per frame)
- **Walkable area**: The geometry defining where agents can move

## Troubleshooting

### "Dependencies not installed" error
- Make sure you ran Blender as Administrator when installing dependencies
- Check the Blender console (Window → Toggle System Console on Windows) for error messages
- Try reinstalling dependencies from the addon preferences

### "File not found" error
- Use absolute paths or ensure the file path is correct
- Check that the SQLite file is a valid JuPedSim trajectory file

### Agents appear at wrong scale
- JuPedSim uses meters as units. Make sure your Blender scene is set to metric units
- Agents are created as 1-meter diameter empty objects (sphere display) by default

### Loading takes too long
- Use the **Load Every Nth Frame** option to downsample the temporal resolution
- For very large simulations, try values like 5 or 10 to significantly reduce loading time
- Linear interpolation will fill in the gaps between keyframes for smooth animation
